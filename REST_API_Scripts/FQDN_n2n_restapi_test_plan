FQDN end to end test plan:
Controller need to finish the initial setup and cloud account setting
1.	Create FQDN testing env:
    a.	One VPC
    b.	2 subnets: (public/private)
    c.	IGW associated to one of the subnet
    d.	Launch an instance in private subnet

2.	Create FQDN through REST API:
    a.	Launch GW with provided info (Region, VPC, subnet and enable VPN?? )
    b.	Create FQDN Tag with black list
    c.	Edit the FQDN rule to block www.yahoo.com
    d.	Attach the GW
    e.	Enable the FQDN tag

3.	Run the FQDN test: (need to think which way is better)
    a.	Way 1:
        i.	SSH into test instance in public subnet and modify the route to point all the traffic to our GW.
        ii.	Run “wget www.yahoo.com” and make sure it is blocked
    b.	Way 2:
        i.	Create OpenVPN connection between the test host and our GW.
        ii.	Connect to the GW then SSH into the test instance
        iii.	From test instance do “wget www.yahoo.com” and make sure it is blocked

4.	Clean up the test env:
    a.	Disable the FQDN tag
    b.	Detach the GW from FQDN tag
    c.	Delete the GW (may need to delete the VPN user first)
    d.	Delete the testing instance (AWS)
    e.	Delete the VPC (AWS)
